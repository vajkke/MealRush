## Brief Overview

With this app, you have the option to select from various meal types, such as lunch or dessert, and diets, such as vegan or paleo, to find the perfect recipe. Additionally, you can specify the
desired calorie, protein, carbohydrate, and fat content of the meal.

I created a mock JSON API and built a server for it using Express.js. The design was done in Figma and the plan was outlined using draw.io.

This is undoubtedly my favorite project and it has greatly advanced my skills.
